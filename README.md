## Open source bios compiled for Lenovo T420 laptop.

I built 3 rom versions each with different graphical intialization methods as i was unsure which one would work best with the not yet supported Ivy Bridge processor i was planning to drop into my thinkpad. Currently i'm using the one with vgabios-2170.rom. 

Upgrades so far
 - Intel 7260 AC wifi card (previously whitelisted)
 - Intel i7-3630QM 3.4 GHz quad core processor (previously unsuported)

A photo demonstrating the success of coreboot can be found in my dotfiles repository.
Here are three photos i took during the reading, compiling and flashing of the coreboot rom.
