# Coreboot rom's for Thinkpad T420.
I made three of them with some small differences regarding graphical intialization.
******** with-native-init *************** is made with the native graphics initialization and no option roms or vga bios
** ****with-original-vgabios **** is made with the vga option rom enabled and original vga bios file extracted with UEFITool from the original bios dump located in bios-backup repository.
**** with-2170-vgabios**** ** is made using the vga bios from https://www.dropbox.com/s/2h9x16kmloofp3y/snb_vbios_2170.rom and is supposed to support ivy bridge cpu's. Will find out when i upgrade. I have a 3rd gen i3 in another laptop but i have to dissasemble both of them in order to do the test.
I'm currently on the ** ****with-2170-vgabios ****, so far it's stable. 
Will add some photos soon.
